# sign-up-form
This is a part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form). The main theme of this project is handling forms.

I tried to faithfully recreate the original design while improving on some details.

### List of additional features: 
- labeling of required fields
- helpful placeholders
- dynamic positive/negative feedback on user input
- responsive design (my honest attempt at it)
- a *primitive* password pattern matching
